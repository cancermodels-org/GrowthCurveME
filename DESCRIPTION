Description: GrowthCurveME is an R package that provides user-friendly
    wrappers to the nlme package for performing linear and non-linear
    mixed-effects regression modeling for in-vitro growth-assay data to
    account for clustering or longitudinal analysis via repeated
    measurements. The package allows users to fit a variety of growth
    models, including linear, exponential, logistic, and Gompertz
    functions. For non-linear models, starting values are automatically
    calculated. The package includes functions for summarizing models,
    visualizing data and results, calculating doubling time and other key
    statistics, and generating model diagnostic plots and residual summary
    statistics. It also provides functions for generating
    publication-ready summary tables for reports. Additionally, users can
    fit linear and non-linear least-squares regression models if
    clustering is not applicable.
