## R CMD check results

* This is a new release.

Some function examples exceed the CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s, 
but the elapsed time remains minimal (a few seconds over). These examples are 
essential to demonstrate the functionality of the package. The package 
functions that employ methods from other R packages include 
hyperlinks directly to the relevant source functions within those packages to 
make user review and interpretation easier.
